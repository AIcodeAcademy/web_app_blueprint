# Type Script rules

- Prefer `type` over `interface`
- Prefer functions over static methods
- Prefer `#` over `_` for private properties
- Avoid `null` and `undefined`
- Prefer named functions over complex anonymous functions
- Avoid deep nested flow structures by using early returns
- Validate data using plain TS functions or ValueObjects if needed
- Avoid external libraries as much as possible

# Html inline 

- Declare an `html` const as `const html = String.raw;` for HTML tagged content

# Folder structure
```txt
docs/
public/
src/
  components/ # for reusable UI components
  domain/ # for business logic
  models/ # for types and interfaces
  styles/ # for global styles
  utils/ # for utility functions
tests/
```

# File structure

- Export only one artifact per file
- Use the following naming convention `{{business}}.{{technical}}.ts`, where 
 - technical is one of: `type`, `component`, `function`
